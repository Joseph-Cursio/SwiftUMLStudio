import ViewInspector

/// ViewInspector reflects into private SwiftUI layout, so an OS update can break
/// it while the public API is unchanged. Two such breaks bit macOS 27 beta:
///
/// - `GeometryProxy` has no public initializer, so ViewInspector fabricates one
///   from a zeroed allocation. Until nalexn/ViewInspector#421 that allocation was
///   a fixed-size `unsafeBitCast` recognizing only 48 and 52 bytes; macOS 27
///   reports 76 and the unguarded fallback trapped.
/// - `AccessibilityProperties` replaced its named members with a generic
///   `storage` array, so every `accessibilityLabel()` lookup threw.
///
/// The first is the dangerous one: a trap is not a test failure, it kills the
/// whole test process, so every suite scheduled alongside it is reported failed —
/// a different set each run, because the scheduling is nondeterministic. The real
/// cause is invisible in that output, because the reported crash site is the
/// Swift stdlib's `unsafeBitCast` rather than ViewInspector.
///
/// These tests exercise the two capabilities directly, on the smallest possible
/// views, so a future regression surfaces as a named failure here instead of as
/// unexplained collateral across the target.
